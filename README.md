# Road-Segmentation-Object-Detection-using-Deep-Learning
In this project, a deep learning-based approach is used for lane detection on semi-urban roads. The proposed model consists of two main components: a CNN architecture, ResNet101, for semantic segmentation to accurately detect and classify road features, and YOLOv8 for object detection.
